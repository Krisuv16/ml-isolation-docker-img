# Antivirus Detection of Containerized Malware in Linux Distributions  
**Capstone Project - Centennial College**  

This project investigates the effectiveness of antivirus detection for containerized malware in Linux distributions. Using the Metasploit Framework, we generate and distribute payloads to test four popular antivirus solutions within Docker containers.  

Additionally, the study explores anomaly detection in Docker images using machine learning, employing **Scikit-learn's Isolation Forest** for anomaly detection and **StandardScaler** for data preparation. The research aims to enhance cybersecurity defenses by identifying weaknesses and improving malware detection in containerized environments.
